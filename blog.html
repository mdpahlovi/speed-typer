                    <h3>Difference between local storage and session storage ?</h3>
                    <p>
                        <span style="font-weight: 500">Ans :</span> The main difference is that while data in
                        localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.
                        Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets
                        created and assigned to that particular tab

                    <h3>Difference between global scope and local scope ?</h3>
                    <p>
                        <span style="font-weight: 500">Ans :</span> Global variables are useful for values that are
                        relatively constant, or that many functions in the script must access, such as a session id. A
                        local variable, however, has a limited scope: it exists only within the block that it is
                        declared in. Once that block ends, the variable is destroyed and its values lost

                        <span style="font-weight: 500">Ans :</span> The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the
                        Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the
                        first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such
                        an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

                        <span style="font-weight: 500">Ans :</span> 1. Variable that is not initialized after declared
                        we will get undefined. 2. If a function with no return. 3. Parameter that is not passed we will
                        get undefined. 4. If return has no value we will get undefined. 5. Property that doesn't exists
                        on an object we will get undefined. 6. Accessing array elements outside of the index range. 7.
                        Deleting an element inside an array value of index is undefine. 8. Set a value directly to
                        undefined.
